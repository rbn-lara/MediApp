# MediApp
Mobile Xamarin Application

## Project Description
This is a project that I made for the operating systems course at university. <br/>
The instructions were to create a mobile app in a crossplatform framework, because of my knowledge in C# I prefered Xamarin Forms.<br/>
The application allows to create a user and login with it. Once inside you can create medical services and make appointments.<br/>
It is clean coded and implements dependency injection of the Xamarin Forms library.

#### Limitations
I had no iPhone or Mac to debug and release the iOS version.<br/>
The app works with a local database using SQLite.<br/>
The UI may not be responsive to large devices as tablets or Large Font configured devices.
